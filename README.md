# NASDAQ_Webscrape
### Written by @cadekeenan, @cadehanrahan, and myself.

Input any NASDAQ ticker and this code will scrape the current description, stock price, daily range, and volume from Google Finance and marketwatch.com. The program contains two files of code... 

- Run the first file, Utilities.py, in order to define the scraping functions. 
- Run the second file, Main.py, to call the input function that allows the user to input any NASDAQ ticker.

Then, simply input the NASDAQ ticker you wish to learn about, and voila!
